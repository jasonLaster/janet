    "content": "The Greene Group\n\n1290 Avenue of the Americas\n\nNew York, NY 10104-0001\n\nTel. +1 (800) 223-6448 PRIVATE WEALTH\n\nApril 11, 2023\nINVESTMENT STRATEGY REVIEW\nAll Cap Intrinsic Value\nFirst Quarter 2023\n\nWe entered 2023 with a cautious outlook due in large part to the Federal\nReserve’s (the “Fed”) aggressive tightening policy which it initiated in an effort to\ncombat inflation. The Fed has raised interest rates nine times since the start of\n2022, and while inflation has retreated from last year’s highs, it remains well\nabove the Fed’s stated goal of 2%. The unprecedented rate increases have\ncaused financial strains in the banking sector, as evidenced by the failures of\nSilicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and the forced takeover of Credit Suisse.\nGiven the restrictive monetary policy, financial strains are likely to continue in\n2023.\nEquity markets kicked off 2023 with a strong January. The broader market as\nmeasured by the S&P 500 Index (the “S&P 500” or the “Index”) rallied more than\n6.00% in January driven largely by a technical bounce off 2022’s lows, only to give\nback almost 40% of that gain in February. After a solid March, the Index ended the\nquarter up 7.50%. Being a “cap weighted” index, the S&P’s return is greatly\ninfluenced by its largest constituents, Apple and Microsoft, which account for\napproximately 13% of the index. These stocks, together with other large\ncapitalization technology stocks, had a significant recovery during the quarter as\ninterest rates declined from the elevated levels they reached earlier in the year.\nThis can be further illustrated by comparing the first quarter returns of the Russell\n3000 Growth Index (up 13.85%) and the Russell 3000 Value Index (up only 0.91%).\nThis is the widest gap between the two benchmarks since 2020. The Tech sector’s\nvaluation has now surpassed the high levels it reached during COVID-19 and sells\nfor over six times sales which we believe is excessive in the current economic\nenvironment. Returns on client portfolios were generally in line with the Russell\n3000 Value Index.\n\nBank failures seem to begin slowly and then gather steam as they progress. The\ndemise of Silicon Valley Bank (SVBI) was no exception. SVBI was considered a\nwell-capitalized bank by federal regulatory standards as recently as the\n\n\nbeginning of March 2023. However, due to a confluence of events\n(mismanagement of the balance sheet, rising interest rates, etc.), depositors lost\nconfidence which led to a classic “run on the bank” triggering the nation’s 16\"\nlargest bank to be the second largest bank failure in US history.\nThe Fed has been raising interest rates for the past year to reduce the elevated\nlevel of inflation. With the announcement this March of another 25 basis point hike,\nthe Federal Funds Rate has increased to a target range of 4.75% to 5.00% from\napproximately 0.33% a little over a year ago. We expect the added stress created\nby the banking crisis to act as incremental tightening as bank lending is likely to\nbecome even more restrictive. Employment, however, has been resilient, and the\nconsumer has continued to spend. Until employment comes under pressure, the\nFed is likely to continue to tighten monetary conditions.\nAs noted in previous letters, one of the best leading indicators of a recession has\nbeen an inverted yield curve which occurs when the yield on shorter securities is\nhigher than that of longer dated bonds. This has been the case for over a year. In\nseven out of the last nine instances when the yield curve was inverted a recession\noccurred within the next 12 to 18 months. The last time the yield curve was as\nsteeply inverted as it has been during this cycle was in 1981 which preceded one\nof the worst recessions since the great depression. Accordingly, it is difficult to\nsee how we can avoid either a recession or a significant economic slowdown.\nDespite the likelihood of an economic slowdown, stock market valuations remain\nelevated particularly given the significant rise in interest rates. S&P 500 earnings\nwere approximately $222 in 2022, and current estimates for 2023 are roughly\n$220, according to Bloomberg. Although current estimates have declined from\napproximately $230 at the beginning of the year, we believe that these estimates\nare likely still too high as it is not uncommon for earnings to decline over 20% in a\nrecession. As shown in the table below, the market, as defined by the S&P 500,\nappears expensive given current estimates and extremely expensive in a\nrecession scenario.\nEarnings Estimates and Valuation\nfor the S&P 500 Index\n\nExpected Earnings PIE (based on 3/31/23 value of 4,109\n\n$220 (Current estimates) 18.68x\n\n$199 (10% decline) 20.65x\n\n$177 (20% decline) 23.21%\n\nSource: Bloomberg Estimates, S&P 500 Index\n\n\nWhile we find the valuation level of the general market to be excessive, our\nportfolio remains attractively valued, in our opinion, and was trading at roughly\n12.14x price to earnings, 1.74x price to sales, and 9.38x price to cash flow, and a\nsignificant discount to our estimates of intrinsic value at the end of the quarter.\nNotwithstanding, should the market experience a selloff, our portfolio will likely\nbe impacted as well.\nGiven the level of economic uncertainty, portfolio activity during the quarter has\nbeen muted as our preference has been to maintain our attractively valued\nholdings. We added to our position in Dominion Energy, a utility holding company\nwith an attractive dividend yield. The company is undergoing a restructuring and\nis one of the nation’s largest producers and distributors of energy. Given the\nturmoil in the banking industry, we performed an extensive analysis on our bank\nholdings. We have limited exposure to regional banks and have decided to hold\nthese positions for now given their favorable risk/reward profiles. With respect to\nthe larger banks, we sold Wells Fargo and initiated a position in Bank of America,\none of the nation’s leading diversified financial institutions which we believe could\nbenefit from the current banking crisis. In accounts that had excess cash\nreserves, we also purchased two-year treasury notes when their interest rates\nspiked above 5%.\nDespite the S&P 500’s rally during the first quarter, our investment thesis remains\nunchanged from year end. We find market valuations to be rich given current\ninterest rates and the risk to earnings estimates, in the event of an economic\nslowdown. Given the steep yield curve inversion, stress in the banking system,\nand inflation still way above the Fed’s target level, a recession is more probable\nthan not which would likely pressure equity prices. We have significant cash\nreserves to put to work in the market when the opportunity presents itself. While\nwe are waiting for a better entry point on new stock ideas, we believe our current\nportfolio is attractively valued and well positioned to produce solid returns as we\nmove through the next economic cycle.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nTHE GREENE GROUP\n\n\nThis material is intended as a broad overview of the portfolio managers’ current style, philosophy and process.

The value of the index now reflects the value available\nin the public markets.

After the birth, the house is closed up and a sign on the front\ndoor announces the new arrival, letting the community know that the new family needs quiet time. The father\nlights a fire next to the mother’s bed, and she and the new baby are wrapped in warm blankets. Mother and baby\nare kept inside this womb-like environment, removed from the demands of daily life, and kept safe from wind and\nrain for several days or weeks, depending on the culture.\nIn the Indian Ayurvedic tradition, new mothers stay at home and are pampered for 22 days after birth. This period\nof rest is considered vital to protect the delicate nervous systems of both mother and infant. Few visitors are\nallowed and mother and child are protected from wind and bad weather.\nIn Japan, a new mother is treated as if she were the baby- she’s put to bed for 30 days, waited on, and indulged\nwhile she recuperates from the birth.\nIn Holland, where many births take place at home, a specially trained live-in maternity nurse stays with the\nmother for the first 8-10 days. She reports directly to the midwife and keeps her posted as to the mother and\nbaby’s progress. She also cooks, cleans, and helps take care of the other children in the family.\nTips from Wise Mamas and Doulas\n“Schedule activities for yourself when your partner is heading back to work or when you have a decrease in help.\nFor instance, | would schedule one outing a day that | could look forward to and felt was something to do for the\nfirst week my partner was back at work DJ, mother of 2\n“Buy yourself a few nice clothes that aren't maternity but not quite your old size for that in-between period™ TN,\nmother of 3\n“Here's an approach to getting as much (or almost as much) sleep as you need: Calculate hours you need\nnightly...since you will no longer get this is one stretch, you will require more hours in bed to get your allotted\namount of sleep. Plan to stay in bed or keep going back to bed until you have slept your allotted number of hours.\nYou do not shower, brush your teeth, or dress early in the morning. You may be in bed from 10pm to noon the next\nday to get eight hours of sleep, but if that's what it takes, do it™ Julie Lefmann, Birth Doula and CMT\n“Let yourself off the hook. Accepting oneself with the same love and kindness that one accepts their baby helps\nsmooth the guilt-ridden, mommy waters...-Anon\nYour postpartum schedule: “...5 days in the bed;\n5 days on the bed; 5 days around the bed.” -Peggy O'Mara\n\n\nSample Postpartum Visitors letter #1\nWe are so impressed with the boundary setting skills of this GO couple that we, with their\npermission, want to share them with you.\nDear Family and Friends,\nWe're so looking forward to introducing you to our Baby Girl!\nWe understand that the times have likely changed a lot since your last newborn experience (or you're a\nnewbie at this thing like us) and want to set some expectations up front so we all have a good\nexperience.\n\no With the new variant we need to ask you to get a COVID test within 48 hours of coming to visit\n(pre-flight is fine), wear an N95 mask on the flight & anywhere in public + indoors when you're\nvisiting and for the week before you visit.

This is extra precautionary but\nwhat our pediatrician recommended based on how much we know about Baby's antibodies from\nmy vaccine + breastfeeding.\n\ne We can't coordinate transportation or meals while you're here, do airport pickups, overnights at\nour house, and likely can’t lend out the car depending on appointment schedules etc.\n\ne We know you're coming from out of town but we won't be “hosting”. Things here are very\nday-by-day and hour-by-hour at that. Expect to coordinate with us day to day and have\nalternative plans. There are lots of great day trips we recommend: Russian River, Point Reyes,\nNapa, Santa Cruz, Monterey, & even Yosemite! Having a plan that doesn't involve us every day is\nbest.\n\ne (Coming to visit in the very early days, while undoubtedly special, means we will just be learning\nour groove as a family of 3. We're still prioritizing rest and just re-entering the world. Expect to\nsee us for a few hours a day at most. Right now, 12-4 is a good window of time for us but\nobviously this will probably change.\n\ne We go to bed with the baby around 7-8 and wake up with her around 9--this gives you a fair\namount of time to explore the east bay & beyond!\n\ne Things that could be helpful: come by and grab the dog for a hike or walk, make a few freezer\nmeals, bring by a coffee & breakfast, drop off or start dinner, take in/pick up the laundry, unload\nor load the dishwasher, take down the garbage, cook a meal & clean it up etc.\n\nOur first month as a new family is really special to us and we're excited to have you witness it! If this\nisn't what you were expecting, please plan to visit us after we're in the swing of things.\nWith Love,\n\n\nSample Postpartum Visitors letter #2\nHello Loved Ones,\nYou are getting this email because you are some of the first people invited to meet our baby! This email\nis intended to clarify how communication will happen around our birth and what you can expect in\nterms of time/expectations at the very beginning of this exciting journey.\nWe are being very intentional about this process, and taking the advice of our midwives very seriously.\nThis means we are prioritizing the health of our little family over all else. Our priorities are to use the\nprecious hours in the hospital to rest, recover, learn and get the expert support we need to start us off\non the right foot.\nWe appreciate in advance that you will show up for us with support, love, acceptance, and\neasygoing-ness as we navigate this exciting and challenging time.\nLabor and Delivery- We have security passes for the labor and delivery floor. Those will be going to\nPartner and Doula. This means that no one else will be invited into L&D at anytime. We will see you\nafter the baby is born. The timeline around this is dependent on many things that happen during labor.\nIf you know that we are in labor, please do not text to ask for progress updates. No one is going to be on\ntheir phone in L&D. Once baby has arrived, Partner will send a quick text message to the whole group\nthat we are safe and sound and will also let you know when we are transferred to postpartum.\nSolo Bonding- For the first 12-24 hours after birth, everyone will leave Partner and me to bond solo\nwith our little one. There is a lot of scientific evidence about the neurological benefits for babies and\n\n\nparents to have lots of early skin-to-skin contact. Of course you can come cuddle with us but want to\nwarn you about this in advance so you aren't disappointed. If this is going to be difficult for you, then\nplease visit us a little later on in our postpartum healing. We promise there will be SO much time for\nholding her once we're home.\n\nVisits- Once we've settled into Postpartum, we ask that you coordinate visits around meal times (and\nplease bring food- apparently the hospital food is wretched!) Please plan to stay no more than 1-1.5\nhours so that we can prioritize resting.\n\nBoobs & Breastfeeding- One of our main goals early on is to get a handle on breastfeeding. This means\n| will be doing it around the clock, whenever the baby wants to feed, | am not going to cover up while |\nfeed so that means you're almost certainly going to see boobs. If that makes you uncomfortable, you are\nwelcome to leave the room but we can’t promise that it won't be happening during the majority of the\ntime you're visiting.\n\nSocial Media- Please do not post anything on social media until after we post something. This might\ntake us as long as a week. We really want to make sure we have time to communicate with all of our\nfriends and family before a big announcement is made. We will send you a few pictures that you can\nsend to your friends via text but we don’t want half naked photos of me with the baby being texted all\nover the place. Early postpartum is a vulnerable time and we want it to be as private as possible.\nPlease confirm that you've read and understand this email. Let us know if you have any clarifying\nquestions. We understand that you may not agree with some of our choices but we ask that you respect\nand honor them. Thank you in advance.\n\nWe are so excited for you to meet our little one! They are so lucky to have you in their life!",

We have completed\nthe assembly of your claim and personally delivered the documents to the California State Controller's\nOffice (SCO) for review.\n\nPursuant to California law, the SCO has six months to review and approve your claim. We typically\ndo not receive any feedback from the claim evaluator during this period unless they need additional\ninformation. After a claim is approved, it typically takes SCO two weeks to issue a check.\n\nWe have structured our claims process to have your claim check mailed directly to you by SCO.\nThis ensures our clients receive their funding as quickly as possible. In fact, most of our clients receive\ntheir funding prior to us even being notified by SCO that the claim has been approved. Accordingly, please\ndo not call us for a status update prior to September 06, 2024, as we will not have any information until\nthat time. We will provide you an update sooner if we receive a response from SCO.\n\nIf you happen to move prior to receiving your check, please update our office with your new\naddress as soon as possible. SCO will not automatically forward your payment and will require\ndocumentation confirming your new address (i.e.. copy of utility bill, pay stub, etc.). Waiting to update\nyour address may cause significant delays in receiving your check.\n\nOur efficient and time-tested systems often result in our firm being the first to notify rightful\nowners/heirs of their entitlement to unclaimed assets. Consequently, our clients are often contacted by\nother companies after we have submitted a claim for review. Accordingly, please do not sign or provide\ndocumentation to another company as this will delay the funding of your claim. We do not partner or\naffiliate with any other company during the process.\n\nWe appreciate your patience and look forward to a successful recovery of the assets you are\nrightfully entitled.\n\nVery truly yours,\nPETTINATO & ASSOCIATES\nRAL\n95% Memaen (a)\nEe iio BEB",

The assessed value is determined as of January 1, 2023.\nThe Assessed Value shown, minus any exemptions for which you may qualify will be the basis for your\n2023-2024 property tax bill.\nIf title was transferred to you after January 1, 2023, your base year value may increase or decrease from\nthe 2023-2024 factored base year value shown above. A separate Notice of Supplemental Assessment will\nbe mailed notifying you of your new base year value as of the date ownership transferred.\nThe Assessor is responsible for assessing property in accordance with Article XIIIA of the California\nState Constitution (Proposition 13). The primary provisions are as follows:\n= Property that has not changed ownership or has not had new construction added since March 1,\n1975 is valued as of that date. There is a 2% maximum inflation factor applied to this value for\neach subsequent year. This inflation factor is based on a year by year comparison of the California\nConsumer Price Index. The product of this application each year results in the factored base value.\n®m For properties that have changed ownership and/or have had new construction added since March 1,\n1975, the date of transfer, the date of completion of new construction, or January 1 if partially\ncomplete is the valuation date. Properties may have multiple valuation dates if more than one re-\nassessable event has occurred. The appropriate inflation factor is applied to each subsequent year.\nFor example, the 2023-2024 factored Proposition 13 value of a property purchased on May 1, 2021 which\nhad new construction completed on May 1, 2022 is comprised of two values. The market value of the\nproperty as of May 1, 2021 is factored for inflation for two years and the market value of the new\nconstruction as of May 1, 2022 is factored for inflation for one year. The 2023-2024 factored base year\nvalue is the sum of these two values.\n111-ITD-IE620N (rev. 6/23)\n312,344\n\n\nHOW TO CONTACT US\nIf you have any questions after reviewing the assessed value on your property, please call (510) 272-3787\nor visit any of our locations at 1221 Oak Street, Rm 145, Oakland, CA 94612-4288 or 7600 Dublin Blvd #270,\nDublin, CA 94568-2909. We are available to assist you with your concerns from 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.\nMonday through Friday in Oakland and Monday through Thursday in Dublin, except holidays. If after\ncontacting this office your value concerns could not be resolved you must file an Assessment Appeal\nApplication with the Clerk, Assessment Appeals Board, P.O. Box 1499, Oakland, CA 94612-1499. For\ninformation on how to obtain and complete an application call (510) 272-6352 or visit their website at\nwww.acgov.org/clerk/assessment.htm. This application must be filed between July 2 and September 15 to\nprotect your appeal rights.\nIn the event that an application is filed, a reduction cannot be made unless the applicant attends and\nanswers all questions pertinent to the inquiry before the County Assessment Appeals Board. However,\nappearance may be waived provided there is a written stipulation signed by the Assessor, County Legal\nOfficer, and the applicant as to the full assessed value of the property and the facts relied upon to warrant\nthe change in assessed value. The County Assessment Appeals Board may either a) accept the stipulation\nor b) reject it and may set or reset the application for a formal hearing. This process is in accordance\nwith California Revenue and Taxation Code Section 1607.\nHOW TO LOWER YOUR TAX LIABILITY\nIf this property is your principal place of residence as of January 1, 2023 you may be entitled to a\nhomeowners’ exemption that could lower your property tax liability. There is no charge to apply for this\nexemption. If no amount is shown on the homeowners’ exemption line on the front of this notice, and you\nbelieve you would qualify, or if an amount is shown and you no longer qualify, please call (510) 272-3770.\nAlso, certain sales/transfers of property between parents and children, and certain sales/transfers between\ngrandparents and grandchildren may qualify for exclusion from reassessment thereby maintaining your\nlower property tax liability. For information call (510) 272-3800.\nWe are available to answer any questions regarding this notification or any other assessment related\nquestions you may have. Please call (510) 272-3787 or our toll free number (800) 660-7725, 9:00 a.m. to\n4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. Our website address is www.acassessor.org.\n111-ITD-IE620C (rev. 6/23)",

According to California state law, if you have\nreached the age of 60 or older on the date your employment ended and were employed by your employer more\nthan five years prior to your qualifying event date, you may be eligible for an extension of benefits at the end of your\nCOBRA continuation period. Please contact the Customer Service Department of your medical insurance carrier\nwithin 30 days of termination of your COBRA continuation period for the necessary election forms and premium\ninformation regarding this coverage extension.\nIf your coverage is terminated due to the expiration of the payment grace period, please note that due to the\nCOVID-18 national public health emergency and the EBSA Disaster Relief Notice 2021-01, COBRA payment\ndeadlines have been adjusted to the earlier of a) 1 year from the original due date, or b) 60 days after the\nannounced end of the National Emergency plus your 30 days.\nPayment for your coverage is due on the first day of each month. If you do not pay by the end of the \"normal\" grace\nperiod of 30 days, coverage for the month is terminated. However, if you subsequently pay the premium before the\ntimelines stated above you may be reinstated.\nPlease note, we have used the information supplied by Sequoia One PEO LLC to calculate your maximum\ncontinuation period under the plan(s) you were insured prior to your qualifying event. If there is a discrepancy\nbetween our calculation and the underwriting insurance carrier, the insurance carrier always governs. Please\ncontact your insurance carrier(s) to determine the exact end of your maximum continuation period.\nFinally, if you are receiving this letter due to the expiration of your maximum continuation period under COBRA, and\nif the last day of your continuation period occurred on a date in the middle of a calendar month, this letter may have\nbeen sent prior to receipt of your payment for your final partial month of coverage. If you have not yet paid for your HL\nfinal partial month of coverage and still intend to do so, you have until the normal expiration of the payment grace ke\nperiod for this final month to postmark your payment.\n00372 040 0003075414 20230705_COBRATERMINATION ProciOnal_BLPOF 1078-1 Page 1 of 2",

It is expected that all\nresidential property insurers and insurance adjusters will comply with the following laws\nfor residential property insurance claims related to a state of emergency (Cal.

This\n\nnotice provides links to each section of the California Insurance Code summarized below.\n\nFor additional information, please review the text of the applicable section of the California\n\nInsurance Code.\n\nSIGNIFICANT CLAIMS AND COVERAGE RELATED LAWS\n\nActual Cash Value Calculation\n\nUnder an open policy, the measure of indemnity in fire insurance is the expense to the\n\ninsured of replacing the thing lost or injured in its condition at the time of the injury, the\n\nexpense being computed as of the time of the commencement of the fire.\n\nUnder an open policy that requires payment of actual cash value, the measure of the\n\nactual cash value recovery, in whole or partial settlement of the claim, for either a total or\n\npartial loss to the structure or its contents, shall be the amount it would cost the insured\n\nto repair, rebuild, or replace the thing lost or injured less a fair and reasonable deduction\n\nfor physical depreciation based upon its condition at the time of the injury or the policy\n\nlimit, whichever is less. A deduction for physical depreciation shall apply only to\n\ncomponents of a structure that are normally subject to repair and replacement during the\n\nuseful life of that structure (Cal. Ins. Code section 2051).\n\nReplacement Cost Value Calculation\n\nUnder an open policy that requires payment of the replacement cost for a loss, the\n\nmeasure of indemnity is the amount that it would cost the insured to repair, rebuild, or\n\nreplace the thing lost or injured, without a deduction for physical depreciation, or the policy\n\nlimit, whichever is less (Cal. Ins. Code section 2051.5[a]).\n\nTime Limit to Collect Full Replacement Cost\n\nAn insured will have no less than 12 months (from the date that the first payment toward\n\nthe actual cash value is made) to collect the full replacement cost of the loss, subject to\n\nthe policy limit. In the event of a loss relating to a “state of emergency,” as defined in\n\nCalifornia Government Code (Gov. Code) section 8558, an insured will have no less than\n\n36 months (from the date that the first payment toward the actual cash value is made) in\n\norder to collect the full replacement cost of the loss, subject to the policy limit. Additional\n\nextensions of six months shall be provided to policyholders for good cause (Cal. Ins. Code\n\nsections 2051.5[b][1]and [2]).\n\nRebuilding in Current Location or Rebuilding or Replacing in a New Location\n\nIn the event of a total loss of the insured structure, a policy issued or delivered in this\n\nstate shall not contain a provision that limits or denies, on the basis that the insured has\n\ndecided to rebuild at a new location or to purchase an already built home at a new\n\nlocation, payment of the building code upgrade cost or the replacement cost, including\n\nany extended replacement cost coverage, to the extent those costs are otherwise covered\n\nby the terms of the policy or any policy endorsement. However, the measure of indemnity\n\nshall not exceed the replacement cost, including the building code upgrade cost and any\n5 P0401T 4/22\n\n80207 000191 001444 CGEFCHO1 23094\n\n\n2023 Annual Notice\n\nPage 3\n\nFebruary 27,2023\n\nextended replacement cost coverage, if applicable, to repair, rebuild, or replace the\n\ninsured structure at its original location (Cal. Ins. Code section 2051.5[c][1]).\n\nLand Value Deduction\n\nFor a residential property insurance policy, the measure of damages available to a\n\npolicyholder to use to rebuild or replace the insured home at another location shall be the\n\namount that would have been recoverable had the insured dwelling been rebuilt at its\n\noriginal location, and a deduction for the value of land at the new location shall not be\n\npermitted from that measure of damages. However, the measure of indemnity shall not\n\nexceed the cost, including the building code upgrade cost and any extended replacement\n\ncost coverage, if applicable, to rebuild the insured structure at its original location (Cal.\n\nIns. Code section 2051.5[c][2]).\n\nList of items Covered — Additional Living Expenses (ALE)\n\nIf requested by the insured, this section requires insurance companies to provide the\n\ninsured with alist of items that an insurer believes would be covered under the policy\n\n(Cal. Ins. Code section 2060(a]).\n\nTime Limit to Collect Additional Living Expenses (ALE)\n\nIn the event of a covered loss relating to a state of emergency, as defined in Gov. Code\n\nsection 8558, on and after July 1, 2021, coverage for additional living expenses (or loss\n\nof use) shall be for at least 24 months from the inception of the loss, but shall be subject\n\nto other policy provisions. An insurer shall grant an extension of up to 12 additional\n\nmonths, for a total of 36 months, if an insured acting in good faith and with reasonable\n\ndiligence encounters a delay or delays in the reconstruction process that are the result of\n\ncircumstances beyond the control of the insured. Circumstances beyond the control of\n\nthe insured include, but are not limited to, unavoidable construction permit delays, lack of\n\nnecessary construction materials, and lack of available contractors to perform the\n\nnecessary work. Additional extensions of six months shall be provided to policyholders\n\nfor good cause (Cal. Ins. Code section 2060[b][1]).\n\nUninhabitable/Reasonable Habitation (ALE)\n\nIf the insured home is rendered uninhabitable by a covered peril, on and after\n\nJuly 1,2021, a policy that provides coverage for additional living expenses shall not limit\n\nthe policyholders right to recovery. However, an insurer may, in lieu of making living\n\nexpense payments required by this subdivision, provide a reasonable alternative remedy\n\nthat addresses the property condition that precludes reasonable habitation of the insured\n\npremises. The additional living expense coverage subject to this section does not include\n\na utility public safety power shut off event, which is the de-energization of a portion of the\n\nelectrical distribution or transmission system to reduce the risk of wildfire ignition (Cal.\n\nIns. Code section 2060[b][2]).\n\nRestricted Access by Civil Authority (ALE)\n\nIn the event of a state of emergency, as defined in Gov. Code section 8558, for aloss\n\nthat is otherwise not subject to Cal. Ins. Code sections 2060 (b)(1) and (2) above that is\n\naccompanied by an order of civil authority restricting access to the home, related to a\nP0O401T 4/22\n\n\n2023 Annual Notice\nPage 4\nFebruary 27,2023\ncovered peril, on and after July 1, 2021, additional living expense coverage shall be\nprovided for at least two weeks. Additional extensions of two weeks shall be provided to\na policyholder for good cause, but shall be subject to other policy provisions (Cal. Ins.\nCode section 2060[c]).\nAdditional Living Expense (ALE) Advance Payment\nIn the event of a covered loss relating to a state of emergency, as defined in Gov. Code\nsection 8558, the following special provision shall apply under a residential property\ninsurance policy:\n(1) If an insured has made a claim for additional living expenses related to a total loss, an\ninsurer shall, upon request by an insured, render an advance payment of no less than\nfour months of living expenses. Additional payment for additional living expenses shall be\npayable upon proper proof following the advance period (Cal. Ins. Code section 2061[a]).\nItemization of Contents\nIn the event of a covered loss relating to a state of emergency, as defined in Gov. Code\nsection 8558, the following special provisions shall apply under a residential property\ninsurance policy:\n(2) If an insured has made a claim for contents related to a total loss of a primary\nresidence, an insurer shall not require that the insured use a company-specific inventory\nform if the insured can provide an inventory using a form that contains substantially the\nsame information. This subdivision does not limit the authority of an insurer to seek\nadditional reasonable information from an insured upon receipt of an inventory form\nsubmitted by an insured.\n(3) If an insured has made a claim for contents related to a total loss of a primary\nresidence, an insurer shall accept an inventory that includes groupings of categories of\npersonal property, including clothing, shoes, books, food items, CDs, DVDs, or other\ncategories of items for which it would be impractical to separately list each individual item\nclaimed (Cal. Ins. Code section 2061[a]).\nChanging Claims Adjusters\nIf, within a six-month period, an insurer assigns a third or subsequent adjuster to be\nprimarily responsible for a claim, the insurer shall provide the insured with a written status\nreport. The written status report must include a summary of any decisions or actions that\nare substantially related to the disposition of a claim, including, but not limited to, the\namount of losses to structures or contents, the retention or consultation of design or\nconstruction professionals, the amount of coverage for losses to structures or contents,\nand all items of dispute (Cal. Ins. Code section 2071).\n\n5] P0O401T 4/22\n80207 000191 001445 CGEFCHO1 23094\n\n\n2023 Annual Notice\n\nPage 5\n\nFebruary 27,2023\n\nNote: In addition to the above, Cal. Ins. Code section 14047 requires that for a claim\n\narising from a state of emergency, if, within a six-month period, an insurer assigns a third\n\nor subsequent first-party real or personal property claims adjuster, the insurer shall\n\nestablish a primary point of contact for the insured and provide the insured one or more\n\ndirect means of communication with the primary point of contact (Cal. Ins. Code section\n\n14047).\n\nAppraisal\n\nIn the event of a government-~declared disaster, as defined in the California Government\n\nCode, appraisal may be requested by either the insured or the insurance company but\n\nshall not be compelled (Cal. Ins. Code section 2071).\n\nCopy of Complete Policy Aftera Loss\n\nAfter a covered loss under a policy covered by Cal. Ins. Code section 2071, an insurer\n\nshall provide to the insured, free of charge, a complete, current copy of their policy within\n\n30 calendar days of receipt of a request from the insured. The policy must include the full\n\ninsurance policy, any endorsements, and the declarations page (Cal. Ins. Code section\n\n2084).\n\nBuilding Cost Upgrade Coverage\n\nAn open policy of residential property insurance that provides replacement cost coverage\n\nshall not be issued or renewed unless it provides additional building code upgrade\n\ncoverage of no less than 10 percent of the dwelling coverage policy limits. The building\n\ncode upgrade coverage required by this subdivision shall be additional coverage, and use\n\nof this coverage shall not reduce or deplete the dwelling coverage policy limits for the\n\ninsured property. Insurers may defer building code upgrade coverage of greater than 10\n\npercent of the dwelling coverage policy limits, in addition to providing the minimum\n\ncoverage of 10 percent of the dwelling coverage policy limits (Cal. Ins. Code section\n\n10103[c]).\n\nAbility to Combine Coverages\n\nIn the event of a claim relating to a state of emergency, an insured under a residential\n\nproperty insurance policy shall be permitted to combine payments for claims for losses\n\nup to the policy limits for the primary dwelling and other structures, for any of the covered\n\nexpenses reasonably necessary to rebuild or replace the damaged or destroyed dwelling,\n\nif the policy limits for coverage to rebuild or replace the primary dwelling are insufficient\n\n(Cal. Ins. Code section 10103.7[a]).\n\nPayment of Contents Without Inventory\n\nIn the event of a covered total loss of a primary dwelling under a residential property\n\ninsurance policy resulting from a state of emergency, if the residence was furnished at\n\nthe time of the loss,\n\n(1) The insurer shall offer a payment under the contents (personal property) coverage in\n\nan amount no less than 30 percent of the policy limit applicable to the covered dwelling\nPO401T 4/22\n\n\n2023 Annual Notice\n\nPage 6\n\nFebruary 27,2023\n\nstructure, up to a maximum of two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000), without\n\nrequiring the insured to file an itemized claim.\n\n(2) After receiving the payment described in paragraph (1), the insured may recover\n\nadditional amounts up to the policy limit for contents coverage by filing a claim pursuant\n\nto the terms of the policy for the loss of contents that exceeds the value of the payment\n\nprovided pursuant to paragraph (1).\n\n(3) When an insured files a claim relating to a state of emergency, as defined in Gov.\n\nCode section 8558, the insurer shall notify the insured of the option to receive payment\n\nfor loss of contents pursuant to paragraph (1) and of the insured’s option to subsequently\n\nfile a full itemized claim pursuant to paragraph (2).\n\n(4) This subdivision does not affect payment under the policy for scheduled personal\n\nproperty.\n\n(5) This section does not prohibit an insurer from restricting payment in cases of\n\nsuspected fraud (Cal. Ins. Code section 10103.7[b]).\n\nSIGNIFICANT RATING AND UNDERWRITING RELATED LAWS\n\nMitigation in Rating Plans and Wildfire Risk Models\n\nWildfire Risk Model or Rating Factor\n\n(h) Provision of wildfire risk score or other wildfire risk classification to policy older or\n\napplicant.\n\nAn insurer utilizing a Wildfire Risk Model, or rating factor, to segment, create a rate\n\ndifferential, or surcharge the premium based upon the policyholder or applicant's wildfire\n\nrisk shall, within one hundred eighty (180) days after the date this section is filed with the\n\nSecretary of State, implement a written procedure to provide, in writing, to each such\n\npolicyholder or applicant for property insurance the wildfire risk score or other wildfire risk\n\nclassification used by the insurer to segment, create a rate differential, or surcharge the\n\npremium based upon the policyholder or applicant's wildfire risk.

This prohibition applies to\nall policies of residential property insurance in effect at the time of the declared state of\nemergency (Cal. Ins. Code section 675.1[b][1]).\nReduction of Limits or Elimination of Coverage\nAn insurer shall deliver to the insured either (1) an offer of renewal of the policy 45 days\nbefore the policy expiration contingent upon payment of premium as stated in the offer,\nand which states any reduction of limits or elimination of coverage, or (2) a notice of\nnonrenewal 75 days prior to the expiration that states the reason or reasons for the\nnonrenewal.\nFor the offer of renewal, the insurer shall identify any reduction of limits or elimination of\ncoverage.

This form provides general\ninformation related to residential property insurance and is not part of your residential property insurance policy.\nOnly the specific provisions of your policy will determine whether a particular loss is covered and the amount\npayable. The information provided does not preempt existing California law.\nPRIMARY FORMS OF RESIDENTIAL DWELLING COVERAGE\n\nYou have purchased the coverage(s) checked below. NOTE: Actual Cash Value Coverage is the most\n\nlimited level of coverage listed. Guaranteed Replacement Cost is the broadest level of coverage.\n\nDwelling Coverage\n\nselected or purchased\n\n[] ACTUAL CASH VALUE COVERAGE for either a total or partial loss to the structure or its\ncontents pays the amount it would cost you to repair, rebuild, or replace the thing lost or injured,\nless a fair and reasonable deduction for physical depreciation based upon its condition at the\ntime of the injury or the policy limit, whichever is less. A deduction for physical depreciation\napplies only to components of a structure that are normally subject to repair and replacement\nduring the useful life of that structure.\n\nREPLACEMENT COST COVERAGE is intended to provide for the cost to repair or replace the\ndamaged or destroyed dwelling, without a deduction for physical depreciation. Many policies pay\nonly the dwelling's actual cash value until the insured has actually begun or completed repairs or\nN reconstruction on the dwelling. Coverage only pays for replacement costs up to the limits\n5 specified in your policy.\n8 EXTENDED REPLACEMENT COST COVERAGE is intended to provide for the cost to repair or\n5 replace the damaged or destroyed dwelling without a deduction for physical depreciation. Many\n2 policies pay only the dwelling's actual cash value until the insured has actually begun or\nn completed repairs or reconstruction on the dwelling. Extended Replacement Cost provides\n8 additional coverage above the dwelling limits up to a stated percentage or specific dollar amount.\n8 See your policy for the additional coverage that applies.\n8\nGUARANTEED REPLACEMENT COST COVERAGE covers the full cost to repair or replace the\ndamaged or destroyed dwelling for a covered peril regardless of the dwelling limits shown on the\npolicy declarations page.\n\n[x] BUILDING CODE UPGRADE COVERAGE, also called Ordinance and Law coverage, covers\nadditional costs to repair or replace a dwelling to comply with the building codes and zoning laws\nin effect at the time of loss or rebuilding. These costs may\notherwise be excluded by your policy. Meeting current building code requirements can add\n\n— significant costs to rebuilding your home. Refer to your policy or endorsement for the specific\ncoverage provided and coverage limits that apply.\nREAD YOUR POLICY AND POLICY DECLARATIONS PAGE CAREFULLY: The policy declarations page shows\nthe specific coverage limits you have purchased for your dwelling, personal property, separate structures such as\n— detached garages, and additional living expenses. The actual policy and endorsements provide details on\nextensions of coverage, limitations of coverage, and coverage conditions and exclusions. The amount of any\nclaim payment made to you will be reduced by any applicable deductibles shown on your policy declarations page.\nIt is important to take the time to consider whether the limits and limitations of your policy meet your needs.\nContact your agent, broker, or insurance company if you have questions about what is covered or if you want to\ndiscuss your coverage options.\nPL-50686 (02-21) Page1 of 3\n\n\nINFORMATION YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT RESIDENTIAL DWELLING INSURANCE\nAVOID BEING UNDERINSURED: Insuring your home for less than its replacement cost may result in your\nhaving to pay thousands of dollars out of your pocket to rebuild your home if it is completely destroyed. Contact\nyour agent, broker, or insurance company immediately if you believe your policy limits may be inadequate.\nTHE RESIDENTIAL DWELLING COVERAGE LIMIT: The coverage limit on the dwelling structure should be high\nenough so you can rebuild your home if it is completely destroyed.\nPlease note:\n\n* The cost to rebuild your home is almost always different from the market value.\n\n* Dwelling coverage limits do not cover the value of your land.\n\n* The estimate to rebuild your home should be based on construction costs in your area and should be\nadjusted to account for the features of your home. These features include, but are not limited to, the\nsquare footage, type of foundation, number of stories, and the quality of the materials used for items such\nas flooring, countertops, windows, cabinetry, lighting, and plumbing.\n\n© The cost to rebuild your home should be adjusted each year to account for inflation.\n\n* Coverage limits for contents, separate structures, additional living expenses and debris removal are\nusually based on a percentage of the limit for the dwelling. If your dwelling limit is too low, these coverage\nlimits may also be too low.\n\nYou are encouraged to obtain a current estimate of the cost to rebuild your home from your insurance agent,\nbroker, or insurance company or an independent appraisal from a local contractor, architect, or real estate\nappraiser. If you do obtain an estimate of replacement value and wish to change your policy limits, contact your\ninsurance company. While not a guarantee, a current estimate can help protect you against being underinsured.\nDEMAND SURGE: After a widespread disaster, the cost of construction can increase dramatically as a result of\nthe unusually high demand for contractors, building supplies and construction labor. This effect is known as\ndemand surge. Demand surge can increase the cost of rebuilding your home. Consider increasing your coverage\nlimits or purchasing Extended Replacement Cost coverage to prepare for this possibility.\n\nCHANGES TO PROPERTY: Changes to your property may increase its replacement cost. These changes may\ninclude the building of additions, customizing your kitchen or bathrooms, or otherwise remodeling your home.\nFailure to advise your insurance company of any significant changes to your property may result in your home\nbeing underinsured.\n\nEXCLUSIONS: Not all causes of damage are covered by common homeowners or residential fire policies. You\nneed to read your policy to see what causes of loss or perils are not covered. Coverage for landslide is typically\nexcluded. Some excluded perils such as earthquake or flood can be purchased as an endorsement to your policy\nor as a separate policy. Contact your agent, broker, or insurance company if you have a concern about any of the\nexclusions in your policy.\n\nCONTENTS (PERSONAL PROPERTY) COVERAGE DISCLOSURE: This disclosure form does not explain the\ntypes of contents coverage provided by your policy for items such as your furniture or clothing. Contents may be\ncovered on either an actual cash value or replacement cost basis depending on the contract. Almost all policies\ninclude specific dollar limitations on certain property that is particularly valuable, such as jewelry, art, or\nsilverware. Contact your agent, broker, or insurance company if you have any questions about your contents\ncoverage. You should create a list of all personal property in and around your home. Pictures and video\nrecordings also help you document your property. The list, photos, and video should be stored away from your\nhome.\n\nPL-50696 (02-21) Page2 of 3\n\n\nFIRE SAFETY RELATED DISCOUNTS\nThe following protective device discounts* are available:\nSprinkler\nSmoke Detector / Alarm System Fire Peril Discount*\n.

The deductible is subtracted only\nfrom the amount of the covered loss to your dwelling caused by earthquake. However, benefits will not be paid\nunder Property Coverage C - Personal Property/Household Furnishings for loss caused by earthquake unless\nthe covered loss to the dwelling caused by earthquake meets or exceeds the deductible. Benefits are paid for\ncovered additional living expenses in the event of loss caused by earthquake without regard to any deductible.\nOptional Earthquake Coverages\n\nCalifornia law requires that optional additional earthquake coverage for the cost of complying with building\ncodes, ordinances, or laws be offered to you. This optional coverage is not provided in the minimum offer of\nearthquake coverage stated on the reverse side of this form. This optional coverage is described below.\nOrdinance or Law Coverage: If you have taken steps to fit, or retrofit, your insured dwelling to reduce the\nearthquake damage hazard, you may purchase coverage for the necessary costs of complying with any\nordinance or law regulating the repair, demolition, and/or reconstruction of your covered dwelling, if it is\ndamaged by earthquake. This optional coverage is in addition to the dollar amount identified on the reverse\nside of this form as the earthquake coverage limit of liability for Property Coverage A - Dwelling.\nState law imposes a minimum offer of $10,000 for this coverage. We offer this coverage with a $10,000 limit.

If your dwelling\nis not retrofitted* a surcharge may apply to the premium.\n“Fit” or “Retrofit” is defined as the tying or bracing of the structure to the foundation, reinforcing the chimney\nand securing the water heater. Evidence of retrofitting is required.\n* A home is considered to be retrofitted if the following conditions apply: Water Heaters, wood stoves, propane tanks strapped or anchored:\nFrame of the house must be bolted to the slab or concrete perimeter foundation walls via sill plates; wood-framed crawl space must be\nstrengthened with plywood panels; living space built over a garage must have metal door frames or bracing and must have plywood panels\non all inside walls for support.

The assessed value is determined as of January 1, 2024.\nIf you agree with your assessed value, no action on your part is needed.\nThe Assessed Value shown, minus any exemptions for which you may qualify, will be the basis of your\n2024-2025 property tax bill. Each fiscal year, the Assessor compares the factored Proposition 13 base\nyear value to the current year January 1 market value and enrolls the lesser of the two. We have enrolled\nthe factored base year value which includes the mandatory California Consumer Price Index increase of\n2% because it is less than the January 1, 2024 market value of your property. If title was transferred\nto you after January 1, 2024, your base year value may increase or decrease from the 2024-2025\nfactored base year value shown above. A separate Notice of Supplemental Assessment will be mailed\nto you notifying you of your new base year value as of the date ownership transferred.\nThe Assessor is responsible for assessing property in accordance with Article XIlIA of the California\nState Constitution (Proposition 13). The primary provisions are as follows:\n= Property that has not changed ownership or has not had new construction added since March 1,\n1875 is valued as of that date. There is a 2% maximum inflation factor applied to this value for\neach subsequent year. This inflation factor is based on a year by year comparison of the California\nConsumer Price Index. The product of this application each year results in the factored base value.\n= For properties that have changed ownership and/or have had new construction added since March 1,\n1875, the date of transfer, the date of completion of new construction, or January 1 if partially\ncomplete is the valuation date. Properties may have multiple valuation dates if more than one re-\nassessable event has occurred. The appropriate inflation factor is applied to each subsequent year.\nFor example, the 2024-2025 factored Proposition 13 value of a property purchased on May 1, 2022 which\nhad new construction completed on May 1, 2023 is comprised of two values. The market value of the\nproperty as of May 1, 2022 is factored for inflation for two years and the market value of the new\nconstruction as of May 1, 2023 is factored for inflation for one year. The 2024-2025 factored base year\nvalue is the sum of these two values.\n111-1TD-IEB20P (rev. 6/24)\n312,046",

The Fed has raised interest rates nine times since the start of\n2022, and while inflation has retreated from last year’s highs, it remains well\nabove the Fed’s stated goal of 2%. The unprecedented rate increases have\ncaused financial strains in the banking sector, as evidenced by the failures of\nSilicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and the forced takeover of Credit Suisse.\nGiven the restrictive monetary policy, financial strains are likely to continue in\n2023.\nEquity markets kicked off 2023 with a strong January. The broader market as\nmeasured by the S&P 500 Index (the “S&P 500” or the “Index”) rallied more than\n6.00% in January driven largely by a technical bounce off 2022's lows, only to give\nback almost 40% of that gain in February. After a solid March, the Index ended the\nquarter up 7.50%. Being a “cap weighted” index, the S&P’s return is greatly\ninfluenced by its largest constituents, Apple and Microsoft, which account for\napproximately 13% of the index. These stocks, together with other large\ncapitalization technology stocks, had a significant recovery during the quarter as\ninterest rates declined from the elevated levels they reached earlier in the year.\nThis can be further illustrated by comparing the first quarter returns of the Russell\n3000 Growth Index (up 13.85%) and the Russell 3000 Value Index (up only 0.91%).\nThis is the widest gap between the two benchmarks since 2020. The Tech sector’s\nvaluation has now surpassed the high levels it reached during COVID-19 and sells\nfor over six times sales which we believe is excessive in the current economic\nenvironment. Returns on client portfolios were generally in line with the Russell\n3000 Value Index.\nBank failures seem to begin slowly and then gather steam as they progress. The\ndemise of Silicon Valley Bank (SVBI) was no exception. SVBI was considered a\nwell-capitalized bank by federal regulatory standards as recently as the",

We have completed\nthe assembly of your claim and personally delivered the documents to the California State Controller's\nOffice (SCO) for review.\n\nPursuant to California law, the SCO has six months to review and approve your claim. We typically\ndo not receive any feedback from the claim evaluator during this period unless they need additional\ninformation. After a claim is approved, it typically takes SCO two weeks to issue a check.\n\nWe have structured our claims process to have your claim check mailed directly to you by SCO.\nThis ensures our clients receive their funding as quickly as possible. In fact. most of our clients receive\ntheir funding prior to us even being notified by SCO that the claim has been approved. Accordingly, please\ndonot call us for a status update prior to September 06, 2024, as we will not have any information until\nthat time. We will provide you an update sooner if we receive a response from SCO.\n\nIf you happen to move prior to receiving your check. please update our office with your new\naddress as soon as possible. SCO will not automatically forward your payment and will require\ndocumentation confirming your new address (i.e.. copy of utility bill, pay stub, etc.). Waiting to update\nyour address may cause significant delays in receiving your check.\n\nOur efficient and time-tested systems often result in our firm being the first to notify rightful\nowners/heirs of their entitlement to unclaimed assets. Consequently, our clients are often contacted by\nother companies after we have submitted a claim for review. Accordingly, please do not sign or provide\ndocumentation to another company as this will delay the funding of your claim. We do not partner or\naffiliate with any other company during the process.\n\nWe appreciate your patience and look forward to a successful recovery of the assets you are\nrightfully entitled.\n\nVery truly yours,\nGit\nPETTINATO & ASSOCIATES\n&BR4,\n95% Meweer Ia)\nER Semmes BBB",

The assessed value is determined as of January 1, 2023.\nThe Assessed Value shown, minus any exemptions for which you may qualify will be the basis for your\n2023-2024 property tax bill.\nIf title was transferred to you after January 1, 2023, your base year value may increase or decrease from\nthe 2023-2024 factored base year value shown above. A separate Notice of Supplemental Assessment will\nbe mailed notifying you of your new base year value as of the date ownership transferred.\nThe Assessor is responsible for assessing property in accordance with Article XIlIA of the California\nState Constitution {Proposition 13). The primary provisions are as follows:\n= Property that has not changed ownership or has not had new construction added since March 1,\n1975 is valued as of that date. There is a 2% maximum inflation factor applied to this value for\neach subsequent year. This inflation factor is based on a year by year comparison of the California\nConsumer Price Index. The product of this application each year results in the factored base value.\n= For properties that have changed ownership and/or have had new construction added since March 1,\n1975, the date of transfer, the date of completion of new construction, or January 1 if partially\ncomplete is the valuation date. Properties may have multiple valuation dates if more than one re-\nassessable event has occurred. The appropriate inflation factor is applied to each subsequent year.\nFor example, the 2023-2024 factored Proposition 13 value of a property purchased on May 1, 2021 which\nhad new construction completed on May 1, 2022 is comprised of two values. The market value of the\nproperty as of May 1, 2021 is factored for inflation for two years and the market value of the new\nconstruction as of May 1, 2022 is factored for inflation for one year. The 2023-2024 factored base year\nvalue is the sum of these two values.\n111-ITD-IE620N (rev. 6/23)\n312,344",

Find a therapist accepting new\nclients before the baby arrives. Consider enlisting the help of a housekeeper, a dog walker, instacart etc. Talk with your\nfamily and friends to see who is available and willing to help. Who and what can help ease your transition to parenthood?\n° A new mother's only job is to breastfeed the baby, rest, and heal. The partner and other support people do\neverything else.\n° Family and friends want to help. Here are some ways you can assist them in actually being_helpful.

This notice is to inform you that, effective as of\nAugust 19, 2024, the Bank, as lender, will cease determining the interest rate for\nAdvances in your LMA Account based on BSBY, and will instead determine your interest\nrate for such Advances based on the daily Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus a\ncredit spread adjustment (“Daily SOFR”), or such successor base rate as the Bank may\ndetermine from time to time.\nDaily SOFR, like BSBY, is a floating rate of interest.

The\nBank will continue to reset your interest rate weekly for such Advances, based upon the\nDaily SOFR rate determined for such reset date, and as described in the updated terms to\nthe New LMA Agreement, defined below.\nThe LMA interest charges, comprised of the successor Daily SOFR base rate and\nSpread, will be reflected on the LMA monthly statement beginning for the period of\nAugust 19, 2024.
